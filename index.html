            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
            been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
            an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
            and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
            12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
